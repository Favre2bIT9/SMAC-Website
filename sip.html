Background and Significance of the Study
</h1>
<p class="text" align="justify">
When composting it can help the communities soil become healthier by giving it nutrients which will also help their plants grow. Composting wasted food can also reduce wastes which will also help our environment become cleaner and healthier through lessening the wasted food that becomes incinerated and pollutes our air as well as lessen landfills and the harm it brings to the environment, such as soil and groundwater contamination.<br><br>
Our partner institution/community can benefit from our composting project, We say this because our project helps provide a solution for their financial problem. Our project aims to provide our partner institution with a independent source of income that they may use to help improve the living environment and fulfill the need of the children, it will benefit them and put the idea of composting to good use, using compost to help improve the quality of the plants will help us attract more customers which will lead for more sales and more income for the institution. In conclusion we believe our project will help benefit the residents in the institution while giving them the opportunity to fulfill their needs.

Problem Statement
</h1>
<p class="text" align="center">
How will banana peels and dry leaves affect the height of the Solanum lycopersicum?
</p>
<h1 align="center">
Hypothesis
</h1>
<p class="text" align="center">
If we use banana peels for composting, then the height and the number of leaves’’ of the Solanum lycopersicum (tomato plant) will increase more than using dried leaves due to the nutrients added to the soil.
</p>

Review of Related Literature
</h1>
<p class="text" align="justify">
Compost is food and other organic waste. Compost improves soil health because of the nutrients from these materials used to create compost which is good for the environment. The plant that our group is focusing on is Solanum lycopersicum. The Solanum lycopersicum plant mostly requires nutrients such as Potassium, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Zinc, Copper, Iron, Magnesium, Calcium, Manganese, Boron and Sulfur, these nutrients help the plant grow properly and healthy for example the zinc can help with the stem growth, all the nutrients plays different and very important roles and each of them helps them germinate, be able to protect themselves, grow healthy and produce seeds, without the nutrients that plant will show signs of nutrient deficiency which can negatively affect the plant greatly. One of the composts we found best worked and was the most suggested was “John Innes No. 2”, this compost contained potassium humate which is the potassium salt of Humic acid it also creates healthy soil conditions through aeration making the soil easier to work with. To apply and use the compost to the plant we must spread several inches of compost on top of the plants soil so that the nutrients will drain down the soil. The water will absorb the nutrients from the compost and will deliver it to the plant. The plant receives the nutrients from the water and will then grow faster than without the composts. Banana peels and dry leaves are also good composts and they are much more available, both improve soil since they give important nutrients to the soil which results in an improved plant growth.

Controlled Set-up
</h1>
<p class="text" align="justify">
The control set-up will have 3 replicates, each of the replicates will be marked with a number from 1-3 and only 1 number for each replicate and each replicate will be marked with letter C and will only use constant variables, the control set-up will have 8 hours of sunlight, 2/4 cup of water for week 1-3, 1 cup of water for week 4-8, ½ liter of water for week 8-12, and the pot sizes will be 1 gallon with 1kg of soil.

</h1>
<p class="text" align="justify">
The experimental set-up 1 will have 3 replicates, each of the replicates will be marked with a number from 1-3 and only 1 number for each replicate and each replicate will be marked with letter A and will use banana peels as its compost and will use constant variables, the experimental set-up 1 will have 8 hours of sunlight, 2/4 cup of water for week 1-3, 1 cup of water for week 4-8, ½ liter of water for week 8-12, and the pot sizes will be 1 gallon with 1kg of soil.

Data Measured
</h1>
<p class="text" align="center">
<u>Height of tomato plant</u><br>
-The tomato plant will be measured every 1 week<br>
-To determine if the plant’s growth is increasing with the use of the compost, measurement related to plant growth rate<br><br>
<u>Number of leaves of the plant</u><br>
-Number of green leaves is counted every 1 week<br>
-One of the dependent variables; a measurement related to plant growth rate<br>

Procedure (Preparing the Pots and the First 3 Weeks of the Experiment)
</h1>
<p class="text" align="justify">
Prepare 9 medium sized 1 gallon pots, the pots will be divided into groups of 3 and will be labeled alphabetically/with a letter. The 3 pots labeled as group C will be controlled, the 3 pots labeled as group A will be using the banana peels as compost, and the 3 pots labeled as group B will be using the dry leaves as compost. Fill all of the pots with loam soil and make sure to have a small hole on every pot and put 1 tomato slice in each of the pots and cover the tomato slices with loam soil. After 3 weeks or so, the tomato plants will be moved into a larger pot which is 5 gallons and each of the large pots will be labeled with the allocated letter and should hold the correct tomato plant, the experiment will then continue.
</p>

Procedure (Observations about the Compost and Frequency of Compost Application)
</h1>
<p class="text" align="center">
The dry leaves and banana peels composts should be 1-2 inches above the loam soil.<br><br>
1 cup of dry leaf compost will be added to the pots, which are labeled group B, every 4 weeks and 1 cup of banana peels compost will be added to the pots, which are labeled group A, every 4 weeks.
<h1 align="center">

Procedure (Observations About the Tomato Plants)
</h1>
<p class="text" align="center">
At the end of each week, not including the first week, the height of the tomato plants will be measured and recorded as well as the number of leaves that they have.
